## Resources


* [W3C Schools](www.w3schools.com)
    * This is my go-to side for questions about CSS and HTML. I used it as a reference many times as I coded this project.

* [Popular Mechanics article on landscaping](https://www.popularmechanics.com/home/lawn-garden/how-to/g2581/landscaping-ideas-for-low-maintenance-yard/?src=TrueAnth_POPMECHANICS_TW&utm_campaign=trueAnthem:+Trending+Content&utm_content=5732a77504d30137ce21f1e6&utm_medium=trueAnthem&utm_source=twitter)
	* I found the images for my website in this article.

* [Flower Images from yopriceville](https://gallery.yopriceville.com/Free-Clipart-Pictures/Flowers-PNG)
	* I used this website to obtain images of flowers.

## Deductions

## Comments
